<p><em>IfcUnitAssignment</em> indicates a set of units which may be assigned. Within an <em>IfcUnitAssigment</em> each unit definition shall be unique; that is, there shall be no redundant unit definitions for the same unit type such as length unit or area unit. For currencies, there shall be only a single <em>IfcMonetaryUnit</em> within an <em>IfcUnitAssignment</em>.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; A <em>IfcProject</em> has a unit assignment which establishes a set of units which will be used globally within the project, if not otherwise defined. Other objects may have local unit assignments if there is a requirement for them to make use of units which do not fall within the project unit assignment.
