<p>The element type <em>IfcDoorType</em> defines commonly shared information
for occurrences of doors. The set of shared information may
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>common properties within shared property sets</li>
<li>common material information</li>
<li>common operation type definitions</li>
<li>common shape representations</li>
</ul>
<p>A door type defines the particular parameter of the lining and
one (or several) panels through the
<em>IfcDoorLiningProperties</em> and the
<em>IfcDoorPanelProperties</em> as predefined property sets
applicable to doors only.</p>
<p>It is used to define a door specification, or door style (i.e.
the specific product information that is common to all
occurrences of that door type). Door types may be exchanged
without being already assigned to occurrences.</p>

NOTE&nbsp; The product representations are defined as representation maps (at the level of the supertype <em>IfcTypeProduct</em>, which gets assigned by an element occurrence instance through the <em>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</em> being an <em>IfcMappedItem</em>.

<p>Occurrences of the <em>IfcDoorType</em> within building models are represented by instances of <em>IfcDoor</em> or <em>IfcDoorStandardCase</em>.</p>

<p class="use-head">Operation type use definition</p>
<p>The <em>IfcDoorTypeOperationEnum</em> defines the general layout
of the door type and its symbolic presentation. Depending on the
enumerator, the appropriate instances of
<em>IfcDoorLiningProperties</em> and <em>IfcDoorPanelProperties</em>
are attached in the list of <em>HasPropertySets</em>. The
<em>IfcDoorTypeOperationEnum</em> mainly determines the hinge side
(left hung, or right hung), the operation (swinging, sliding,
folding, etc.) and the number of panels.</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; There are different definitions in
various countries on what a left opening or left hung or left
swing door is (same for right). Therefore the IFC definition may
derivate from the local standard and may need to be mapped
appropriately.</blockquote>

<em>IfcDoorTypeOperationEnum</em> for the correct usage of opening
symbols for different operation types.</p>
<p class="use-head">Material Use Definition</p>
<p>The material of the <em>IfcDoorType</em> is defined by the
<em>IfcMaterialConstituentSet</em> or as fall back by
<em>IfcMaterial</em> and attached by the
<em>IfcRelAssociatesMaterial</em><em>.RelatingMaterial</em>. It is
accessible by the inverse <em>HasAssociations</em>
relationship.</p>
<p>The following keywords for
<em>IfcMaterialConstituentSet.MaterialConstituents[n].Name</em>
shall be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>'Lining' - to indicate that the material constituent applies
to to the door lining</li>
<li>'Framing' - to indicate that the material constituent applies
to to the door framing, if not provided, the 'Lining' material
information applied to frams as well</li>
<li>'Glazing' - to indicate that the material constituent applies
to to the glazing as well</li>
</ul>
<p>If the fall back single <em>IfcMaterial</em> is referenced, it
applies to the lining and framing of the door.</p>


<p class="use-head">Geometry Use Definitions</b></u>:</p>
<p>The <em>IfcDoorType</em> may define the common shape of door
occurrences. The common shape can be defined by</p>
<ul>
<li>applying shape parameters defined within the associated
<em>IfcDoorLiningProperties</em> and <em>IfcDoorPanelProperties</em>
applied to the 'Profile' geometric representation. It is only
applicable if the <em>IfcDoorType</em> has only occurrences of type
<em>IfcDoorStandardCase</em> (See geometric use definition of
<em>IfcDoorStandardCase</em> for further information).</li>
<li>applying the <em>RepresentationMaps</em> attribute to refer to
a list of <em>IfcRepresentationMap</em>'s, that allow for multiple
geometric representations (e.g. with
<em>IfcShapeRepresentation</em>'s having an
<em>RepresentationIdentifier</em> 'Box', 'Profile', 'FootPrint', or
'Body')

<blockquote class="note">

defined as <em>RepresentationMaps</em> (attribute of the supertype

information.</small></blockquote>
