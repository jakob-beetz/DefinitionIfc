<p>A slab is a component of the construction that normally encloses a space vertically. The slab may provide the lower support (floor) or upper construction (roof slab) in any space in a building.</p>
<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 6707-1<br> 
thick, flat or shaped component, usually larger than 300 mm square, used to form a covering or projecting from a building.</blockquote>

<p> Only the core or constructional part of this construction is considered to be a slab. The upper finish (flooring, roofing) and the lower finish (ceiling, suspended ceiling) are considered to be coverings. A special type of slab is the landing, described as a floor section to which one or more stair flights or ramp flights connect.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; There is a representation of slabs for structural analysis provided by a proper subtype of
<em>IfcStructuralMember</em> being part of the <em>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</em>.

NOTE&nbsp;Â An arbitrary planar element to which this semantic information is not applicable or irrelevant shall be modeled as <em>IfcPlate</em>.

<p>A slab may have openings, such as floor openings, or recesses.
They are defined by an <em>IfcOpeningElement</em> attached to the
slab using the inverse relationship <em>HasOpenings</em> pointing
to <em>IfcRelVoidsElement</em>.</p>
<p>There are three entities for slab occurrences:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>IfcSlabStandardCase</em> used for all occurrences of slabs,
that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully
described by the <em>IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage</em>. These slabs are
always represented geometrically by a 'SweptSolid' geometry (or
by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D
geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to
have a corresponding <em>IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage</em>
assigned.</li>
<li><em>IfcSlabElementedCase</em> used for occurrences of slabs
which are aggregated from subordinate elements, following
specific decomposition rules expressed by the mandatory use of
<em>IfcRelAggregates</em> relationship.</li>
<li><em>IfcSlab</em> used for all other occurrences of slabs,
particularly for slabs with changing thickness, or slabs with non
planar surfaces, and slabs having only 'SweptSolid' or 'Brep'
geometry.</li>
</ul>
