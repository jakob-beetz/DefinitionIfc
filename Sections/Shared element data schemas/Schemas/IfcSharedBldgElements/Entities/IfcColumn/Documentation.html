<p><An <em>IfcColumn</em> is a vertical structural member which often is aligned with a structural grid
intersection. It represents a vertical, or nearly vertical, structural member that transmits, through compression, the weight
of the structure above to other structural elements below. It represents such a member from an architectural point of view. It
is not required to be load bearing.</p>
<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 6707-1<br>
structural member of slender form, usually vertical, that transmits to its base the forces, primarily in compression, that are applied to it.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The representation of a column in a structural analysis model is provided by
<em>IfcStructuralCurveMember</em> being part of an <em>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</em>.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; For any longitudial structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where
this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity <em>IfcMember</em> exists.</blockquote>
<p>The IFC specification provides two entities for column occurrences:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>IfcColumnStandardCase</em> used for all occurrences of columns, tthat have a profile defined that is swept along a
directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its
cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the <em>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</em>. These beams are always
represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping'
geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a
corresponding <em>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</em> assigned.
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; View definitions and implementer agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types,
for example by excluding tapering from an <em>IfcColumnStandardCase</em> implementation.</blockquote>
</li>
<li><em>IfcColumn</em> used for all other occurrences of columns, particularly for columns with changing profile sizes along the
extrusion, or columns defined by non-linear extrusion, or columns having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry.</li>
</ul>
