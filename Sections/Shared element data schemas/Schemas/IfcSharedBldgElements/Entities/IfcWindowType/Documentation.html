<p>The element type
<em>IfcWindowType</em> defines commonly shared information for
occurrences of windows. The set of shared information may
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>common properties within shared property sets</li>
<li>common material information</li>
<li>common partitioning of panels</li>
<li>common operation types of panels</li>
<li>common shape representations</li>
</ul>
<p>A window type defines the particular parameter of the lining
and one (or several) panels through the
<em>IfcWindowLiningProperties</em> and the
<em>IfcWindowPanelProperties</em> as predefined property sets
applicable to windows only.</p>
<p>It is used to define a window specification, or window style
(the specific product information that is common to all
occurrences of that window type). Window types may be exchanged
without being already assigned to occurrences.</p>
<p>Occurrences of the <em>IfcWindowType</em> within building models
are represented by instances of <em>IfcWindow</em> or
<em>IfcWindowStandardCase</em>.</p>

<blockquote class="history">
HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC4. The entity <em>IfcWindowType</em> replaces the previous definition <em>IfcWindowStyle</em> (which is deprecated in IFC4).</blockquote>

<p class="use-head">Partitioning type use definition</p>
<p>The <em>IfcWindowTypePartitioningEnum</em> defines the general
layout of the window type and its symbolic presentation.
Depending on the enumerator, the appropriate instances of
<em>IfcWindowLiningProperties</em> and
<em>IfcWindowPanelProperties</em> are attached in the list of
<em>HasPropertySets</em>. The <em>IfcWindowTypePartitioningEnum</em>
mainly determines the way of partitioning the window into
individual window panels and thereby number and position of
window panels.</p>
<p>See geometry use definitions at
<em>IfcWindowTypePartitioningEnum</em> for the correct usage of
panel partitioning and <em>IfcWindowPanelProperties</em> for the
opening symbols for different panel operation types.</p>
<p class="use-head">Material Use Definition</p>
<p>The material of the <em>IfcWindowType</em> is defined by the
<em>IfcMaterialConstituentSet</em> or as fall back by
<em>IfcMaterial</em> and attached by the
<em>IfcRelAssociatesMaterial</em><em>.RelatingMaterial</em>. It is
accessible by the inverse <em>HasAssociations</em>
relationship.</p>
<p>The following keywords for
<em>IfcMaterialConstituentSet.MaterialConstituents[n].Name</em>
shall be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>'Lining' - to indicate that the material constituent applies
to to the window lining</li>
<li>'Framing' - to indicate that the material constituent applies
to to the window panels, if not provided, the 'Lining' material
information applied to panels as well</li>
<li>'Glazing' - to indicate that the material constituent applies
to to the glazing part</li>
</ul>
<p>If the fall back single <em>IfcMaterial</em> is referenced, it
applies to the lining and framing of the window.</p>

<p class="use-head">Geometry Use Definitions</b></u>:</p>
<p>The <em>IfcWindowType</em> may define the common shape of window
occurrences. The common shape can be defined by</p>
<ul>
<li>applying shape parameters defined within the associated
<em>IfcWindowLiningProperties</em> and
<em>IfcWindowPanelProperties</em> applied to the 'Profile'
geometric representation. It is only applicable if the
<em>IfcWindowType</em> has only occurrences of type
<em>IfcWindowStandardCase</em> (See geometric use definition of
<em>IfcWindowStandardCase</em> for further information).</li>
<li>applying the <em>RepresentationMaps</em> attribute to refer to
a list of <em>IfcRepresentationMap</em>'s, that allow for multiple
geometric representations (e.g. with
<em>IfcShapeRepresentation</em>'s having an
<em>RepresentationIdentifier</em> 'Box', 'Profile', 'FootPrint', or
'Body')
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The product shape representations are
defined as <em>RepresentationMaps</em> (attribute of the supertype
<em>IfcTypeProduct</em>), which get assigned by an element
occurrence instance through the
<em>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[n]</em> being an
<em>IfcMappedItem</em>. See <em>IfcTypeProduct</em> for further
information.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The values of attributes
<em>RepresentationIdentifier</em> and <em>RepresentationType</em> of
<em>IfcShapeRepresentation</em> are restricted in the same way as
those for <em>IfcWindow</em> and
<em>IfcWindowStandardCase</em></blockquote>
