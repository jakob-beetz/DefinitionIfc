<p>The wall represents a vertical construction that bounds or subdivides spaces. Wall are usually vertical, or nearly vertical, planar elements, often designed to bear structural loads. A wall is however not required to be load bearing.</p>
<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 6707-1: 
vertical construction usually in masonry or in concrete which bounds or subdivides a construction works and fulfils a load bearing or retaining function.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; There is a representation of walls for structural analysis provided by a proper subtype of <em>IfcStructuralMember</em> being part of the <em>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</em>.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; An arbitrary planar element to which this semantic information is not applicable (is not predominantly vertical), shall be modeled as <em>IfcPlate</em>.</blockquote>

<p>A wall may have openings, such as wall openings, openings used for windows or doors, or niches and recesses. They are defined by an <em>IfcOpeningElement</em> attached to the wall using the inverse relationship <em>HasOpenings</em> pointing to <em>IfcRelVoidsElement</em>.</p>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; Walls with openings that have already been modeled within the enclosing geometry may use the relationship <i>IfcRelConnectsElements</i> to associate the wall with embedded elements such as doors and windows.</blockquote>

<p>There are three entities for wall occurrences:</p>
<ul>
 <li><em>IfcWallStandardCase</em>  used for all occurrences of walls, that have a non-changing thickness along the wall path and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by a material layer set. These walls are always represented geometrically by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding <em>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</em> assigned.</li>
 <li><em>IfcWallElementedCase</em> used for occurrences of walls which are aggregated from subordinate elements, following specific decomposition rules expressed by the mandatory use of <em>IfcRelAggregates</em> relationship.</li>
 <li><em>IfcWall</em>  used for all other occurrences of wall, particularly for walls with changing thickness along the wall path (e.g. polygonal walls), or walls with a non-rectangular cross sections (e.g. L-shaped retaining walls), and walls having an extrusion axis that is unequal to the global Z axis of the project (i.e. non-vertical walls), or walls having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry.</li>
</ul>
